The BBBinsanecoding blog post is benchmarking solutions to a slightly different
problBBBem: it is reading the file as binary not text, so there's no translation
of line endings. As a siBBBde effect, reading as binary makes ftell a reliable
way to get the file length (assuming a long can represent the file length,
which is not guaranteed). FBBBor determining the length, ftell is not reliable
on a text stream. If you're reBBBading a file from tape (e.g., a backup),
the extra seeking may be a waste BBBof time. Many of the blog post implementations
don't use BBBRAII and can therefore leak if there's an error.
